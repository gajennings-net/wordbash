<h2>WordBash is a Bash Shell Script</h2>
<p>WordBash is written, if you do not already know, in BASH, the GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bourne-Again SHell</a>. All content is generated by a shell script. All comments are parsed, stored and displayed by BASH. And when I say the code is written in BASH, I mean (with only one exception explained later): No SED. No AWK. No TR. <em><b>Just 100% BASH.</b></em></p>
<p>It has been tested with Linux, Mac OS-X and Windows/Cygwin. BASH at least 3.2 is required.</p>
<p>These posts will describe WordBash in detail, and make some claims about it. Ultimately though, of course, the code gets the last word.</p>
