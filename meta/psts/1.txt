## WordBash is a Bash Shell Script

WordBash is written, if you do not already know, in BASH, the GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bourne-Again SHell</a>. All content is generated by a shell script. All comments are parsed, stored and displayed by BASH. And when I say the code is written in BASH, I mean (with only one exception explained later): No SED. No AWK. No TR. **Just 100% BASH.**

It has been tested with Linux, Mac OS-X and Windows/Cygwin. BASH at least 3.2 is required.

These posts will describe WordBash in detail, and make some claims about it. Ultimately though, of course, the code gets the last word.
