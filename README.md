# WordBash
## WordPress Clone Written in Bash

**This is just getting started and is currently (5 Nov 2022) not complete.**

### WordBash is 1,200 lines of Bash code that looks just like *WordPress*

Has been tested with *Linux*, *OS-X* and *Windows/Cygwin* and *Bash 3.2* and 
higher. It is a **CGI** script and has only been tested with *Apache*.

Please note that this is just a "first release" and lacks many features 
normally found in *WordPress*. There are also some things that may look hastily 
designed, and there are some things that may look unfinished, the result of 
"reduction" to make this code as small as possible. (It's kinda "Planned 
Obsolescence", but not exactly...)

**The code is weird.** And I make the claim that it is **Object Oriented**.

## INSTALL

Needs to be installed the ancient way: download the archive and unzip into a 
web-server directory. Then check file permissions and the *Apache* `.htaccess` 
file, and then see if it runs. (If not, it's a setup thing... or a The Coder 
screwed up thing...)

later more...
