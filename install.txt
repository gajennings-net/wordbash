To test this code without a server it can be run interactively by:

	$ cd [path-to-wordbash]
	$ bash -i
	$ . ./B.sh
	$ help

Currently though, the help files/documentation is incomplete.

To test with Apache these files need to be somewhere accessible by it, e.g. 
http://localhost/wordbash/. See README for more information.

For comments to be saved the path meta/cmts/ and the file meta/cmts/.cmts 
needs HTTP server write permission.
